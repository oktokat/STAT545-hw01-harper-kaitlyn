## STAT545-hw01-harper-kaitlyn

### Introduction
Hi! I'm Kaitlyn Harper, a second year MSc student in the School of Population and Public Health. Yes, yes, I realize my github name is oktokat (:octocat:), which is not my real name. I created my username a couple years ago when I was just starting to mess around in github (I'm still a huge newb though, so don't get any ideas). It's a little inconvenient to change the name now... and let's be honest, I'm a little emotionally attached.

### Important things
I edited this README file locally, then committed and pushed it to github! I've had a tiny bit of experience on github, so I didn't have any issues getting it up there :)

### Helpful links!
