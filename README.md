## STAT545-hw01-harper-kaitlyn

### Introduction
Hi! I'm Kaitlyn Harper, a second year MSc student in the School of Population and Public Health. Yes, yes, I realize my github name is oktokat (:octocat:), which is (obviously) not my real name. I created my username a couple years ago when I was just starting to mess around in github. It's a little inconvenient to change the name now... and let's be honest, I'm a little emotionally attached.

_Other things about me:_
- I study molecular epidemiology and my thesis is on improving intestinal health of women and children in developing countries
- I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, and I'm pretty obsessed with the fact that Canadians put seemingly unnecessary u's in words:
    + My favo(u)rite colo(u)r is purple
    + My neighbo(u)r's name is George
- Actual footage of me when I see bunnies at Jericho Beach:

### Important things
I edited this README file locally, then committed and pushed it to github! I've had a tiny bit of experience on github and the computer gods smiled upon me this morning, so I didn't have any issues getting it into my repo on github :)
