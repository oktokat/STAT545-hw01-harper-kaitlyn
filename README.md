## STAT545-hw01-harper-kaitlyn

### Introduction
Hi! I'm Kaitlyn Harper, a second year MSc student in the School of Population and Public Health. Yes, yes, my github name is oktokat :octocat:, which is (obviously) not my real name. I created my username a couple years ago when I was just starting to mess around in github. It's a little inconvenient to change the name now... and let's be honest, I'm a little emotionally attached.

_Other things about me:_
- I study molecular epidemiology and my thesis is on improving intestinal health of women and children in developing countries
- I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, and I'm pretty obsessed with the fact that Canadians put seemingly unnecessary u's in words:
    + My favo(u)rite colo(u)r is purple
    + My neighbo(u)r's name is George
- Actual footage of me when I see bunnies at Jericho Beach (note, I'm the one in the hat):

### Important things
I edited this README file locally, then committed and pushed it to github! I've had a tiny bit of experience on github and the computer gods smiled upon me this morning, so I didn't have any issues getting it into my repo on github :)

One problem I did find interesting: I tried to use color for my Rmd chunks (I just looked it up online and found some code), and it worked when I was knitting to html. Howeverm when I changed the output to a github_document, the color stopped showing up. This is probably due to the fact that I was using html code to create the color, which seems obvious now that I think about it, but for some reason I didn't expect it to stop working for the github doc. That said, if you have an easy solution for making colorful chunks in the output doc (because color = fun!), please let me know :smiley:
